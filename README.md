# Zomato-Data-Analysis-Project
The Zomato Data Analysis project involved analyzing restaurant data from the Zomato website, focusing on establishments in Bengaluru. The dataset included various attributes such as restaurant name, address, ratings, online ordering availability, cuisine types, and more. The primary objectives were to explore the relationship between online ordering and restaurant ratings, perform bi-gram and trigram analysis on the data, extract geographical coordinates, and build geographical heat maps.

Approach:
1. *Data Collection and Preprocessing:*
   - The project began with collecting data from the Zomato website, which included attributes such as restaurant name, address, ratings, etc.
   - Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, standardizing data types, and cleaning the dataset.

2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*
   - EDA was conducted using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NLTK.
   - Analysis included examining the distribution of ratings, exploring the relationship between online ordering availability and restaurant ratings, and performing bi-gram and trigram analysis on restaurant names, addresses, and cuisines.
   - Geographical coordinates were extracted from the address data, and heat maps were built to visualize restaurant concentrations across Bengaluru.

*Key Findings:*
1. **Relation Between Online Order Option and Rating:**
   - Analyzed the correlation between online order availability and restaurant ratings.
   - Determined whether restaurants offering online ordering tend to have higher ratings compared to those without this option.

2. *Bi-gram & Trigram Analysis:*
   - Conducted bi-gram and trigram analysis on restaurant names, addresses, and cuisines to identify common patterns and phrases.
   - Explored insights into popular restaurant names, common cuisines, and prominent locations.

3. *Geographical Coordinates Extraction:*
   - Extracted geographical coordinates from restaurant addresses to facilitate spatial analysis.

4. *Geographical Heat Maps:*
   - Built geographical heat maps to visualize the concentration of restaurants across Bengaluru.
   - Conclusions drawn from heat maps included insights into restaurant distribution patterns and potential locations for new ventures.

*Technologies Used:*
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

*Conclusions:*
1. Restaurants tend to concentrate in central Bengaluru, with a higher density of establishments in this area.
2. As we move away from central Bengaluru, the density of restaurants decreases, indicating less competition in these areas.
3. Potential restaurant entrepreneurs can leverage these insights to identify strategic locations for their ventures, focusing on areas with lower restaurant density for higher chances of success.
4. Geographical heat maps serve as valuable tools for visualizing spatial data and identifying trends or patterns in restaurant distribution across Bengaluru.
